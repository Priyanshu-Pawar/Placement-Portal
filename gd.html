            Learn how to kick-start your preparation for Group Discussion – how, what and from where of GDs</div>
    </div>
    <h2><strong>What is GD &amp; its process?</strong></h2>
    <div class="what">
        <p>Before beginning your GD preparation, it would be wise to understand what it is.<br> GD is a discussion
            within a
            group of individuals to develop a better perspective on <br>issues by bringing out diverse view points. Once
            the
            results of the written exam are out,<br> candidates are shortlisted for the ‘Group Discussion and Personal
            Interview’ (GDPI) round.</p>

    <h2><strong>How to prepare for GD?</strong></h2>
    <div class="how">
        <img src="img1\R.jpg">
        <p> GD is test that not only judges the knowledge but more importantly<br>
            the character of an individual. Since character traits cannot be shaped in <br>
            a few days, it is never too early or too late to begin preparing for GD.&nbsp;,<br>
            Follow the given steps to kick-start your preparation:</p>
    </div>
    <div><strong>Step 1: Self-Assessment</strong></div>
    <div class="Steps">The first step in preparing for GD is a true self-assessment to know your inner strengths and
        weaknesses. For
        instance, it is pertinent to be aware of your level of comfort in public speaking. If this is an area that gives
        you jitters, it will be more relevant to build confidence through mock group discussions and practise.</div>
    <div><strong>Step 2: Building your own repertoire of knowledge</strong></div>
    <div class="Steps">You can be confident in speaking if you have well-prepared knowledge of relevant facts and
        opinions on diverse
        topics. The GD topic given on that day could be from any field – economics, management, environment,
        socio-cultural issues, etc. Therefore, it is advisable to prepare your key content beforehand. Go through common
        GK and keep track of major current events. Do a lot of reading around diverse topics to gather information and
        facts. It is also important to form your own opinion on major issues.</div>
    <div><strong>Step 3: Go through previous year GD Topics</strong></div>
    <div class="Steps">This will help you understand the different kinds of GD topics that are given and be better
        prepared for them.
        The GD topics can be broadly divided into three categories: (1) Factual Topics that based on static or dynamic
        knowledge of specific concepts; (2) Abstract Topics that assess your creative thinking by judging the way you
        perceive something; and (3) Case-based Topics that seek a solution to a given problem in a realistic situation
        with constraints and conditions. You can also go through important topics expected in the upcoming GDPI session.
    </div>
    <div><strong>Step 4: Building necessary Personality Traits</strong></div>
    <div class="Steps">While one cannot acquire virtues of character such as humility and patience, there are certain
        personality
        traits that can be inculcated through deliberate attempt. For instance, building communication skill is crucial
        for GD preparation. ‘Good communication skills’ require a person to be more tolerant of diverse opinions. Only
        those who make efforts to understand the entirety of any issue will be receptive of new and opposing ideas.
        Similarly, if you practise solving multiple case-studies using different methods, you can intentionally inherit
        ‘problem-solving skills’ and ‘creative thinking’.</div>
    <div><strong>Step 5: Clarity of thought and expression</strong></div>
    <div class="Steps">
        Lastly, clear thinking and presentation of ideas is the key to success. There are several tools that can be
        learnt and adopted for creating ideas and content for GDs. However, the way to set forth your ideas is an art.
        “<em>Practice, Practice and Practice</em>” is the mantra to swear by if you wish to learn the art of structuring
        and presenting your ideas at the right time and right moment. You can rehearse through mock-GDs or with a group
        of friends/ colleagues, but practice if you want to prepare for GD!

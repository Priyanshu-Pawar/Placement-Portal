                    should prepare for during and after the interview . In this article, we take a look at the steps

                    <h2>How to prepare for a job interview: Pre-interview preparation
                    </h2>
                    <h3>The following are some essential steps for pre-interview preparation:</h3>
                    <h2>1. Review the job description</h2>
                    <p>Read the job description to thoroughly understand how the employer has described the position and
                        the type of candidate they are looking for. Carefully review the keywords and key phrases the
                        employer uses to describe their expectations. The more you can align your skills and
                        qualifications with the job description, the better chances you stand to impress the
                        interviewer. You may also get some clues from the job description about the questions the
                        interviewer may ask.</p>

                    <h2>2. Consider your eligibility for the job</h2>
                    <p>Think about your qualifications and experience. Ask yourself why you should apply for that job
                        and why the employer should hire you. Assessing how the job fits into your career path and what
                        value you can add to the company will help you convince the interviewer about what makes you the
                        best candidate for the position.</p>
                    <h2>3. Learn more about the company</h2>
                    <p>Get in-depth information about the company through its website, social media pages, employee
                        reviews and other online sources. Find out about its mission, management, work culture, the
                        types of products it offers and the types of clients it serves. Get some insight on its latest
                        revenue, growth prospects and business plans. Most companies display information about the
                        management on their "about us" page, employment-related information on their "careers" or "work
                        with us" page and information for investors on their "investor relations" page.

                        Researching the company well will help you align your CV with its expectations. It will also
                        help you answer questions about the firm during the interview. </p>

                    <h2>4. Prepare a list of expected interview questions</h2>
                    <p>Make a list of common interview questions for the given position and frame thoughtful answers.
                        Prepare impressive responses to questions that give you an opportunity to highlight your skills
                        and interest in the job. In addition to position-specific questions, here are some common
                        questions to include in your list:

                        Tell me about yourself.
                        Why are looking for a job change?
                        Why do you want this job?
                        What are your strengths and weaknesses?
                        What motivates you?
                        Where do you see yourself in five years?</p>
                    <h2>5. Practice mock interviews</h2>
                    <p>No matter how well you prepare, it is natural to feel anxious and overwhelmed at the time of the
                        interview. Mock interviews can be a great help in this regard. They can create a real
                        interview-like environment and help boost your confidence. Ask your friends or family to conduct
                        a mock interview for you. Consider recording the entire process to analyse your performance. If
                        you can't find anyone to play the interviewer, you can rehearse the interview in front of a
                        mirror.</p>
                    <h2>6. Organise your documents</h2>
                    <p>You may have applied using a digital copy of your CV, but it always helps to keep hard copies of
                        all your documents with you, just in case the interviewer needs them for easy access. Take a
                        printout of your resume and cover letter. Put all the important documents including your mark
                        sheets, certificates, ID proofs and photographs in a folder. If the HR has asked you to bring
                        any particular documents like salary slips, relieving letter from previous employer or bank
                        statement , be sure to keep them ready as well.</p>
                    <h2>7. Update your social media profile</h2>
                    <p>If you are on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or any other social media platform, make sure you have
                        an
                        updated profile. Employers often check your social media presence to get an idea about your
                        personality and background. Search for your name in Google to see what results turn up. If there
                        is
                        anything unpleasant, prepare yourself for a response if the interviewer asks about it.</p>

                    <h2>8. Make travel arrangements</h2>
                    <p>Familiarise yourself with the location map that the company has sent you. You can also check
                        directions to the venue using Google Maps. Based on the distance and the time it would take to
                        commute, plan your timing and decide on the mode of transport. Have contact information of the
                        HR
                        department ready with you just in case you need any help locating the company.</p>

                    <h2>9. Decide on your interview dress</h2>
                    <p>Choose a formal dress that you would be wearing for the interview. Make sure the clothes are
                        clean
                        and wrinkle-free. If you plan to spray deodorant or perfume, make sure it is mild. Overall, plan
                        for
                        a neat and clean look with well-cut hair and shaved or trimmed beard.</p>

    <h1>How to Prepare for HR Interviews</h1>
    <p>Good academic records and sound technical knowledge alone are not sufficient to guarantee you a Job. Every
        company conducts an HR interview round to judge your personality, your strengths, your weaknesses, your
        capability to handle the role, to check your background, and to understand if you’re the right fit for this job.
        The HR round is generally the last round in the recruitment process of any company.</p>
    <h3 align="center">Questions you can expect in an HR interview</h3>
    <p>We have done some research and prepared a set of questions that are most commonly asked in HR interviews. If you
        are preparing for HR interviews, you can expect some questions from the below list during the interview:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduce Yourself</strong> or <strong>Tell me about yourself</strong>. This is the very first
            question and will be surely asked in every interview rounds. The best way of answering this question is to
            tell the interviewer about your interests, skill sets, qualifications, achievements etc. Try to avoid
            telling things that are already mentioned in your resume and also make sure not to sound like you have
            mugged this answer.</li>
        <li><strong>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</strong> This is one of the most commonly asked questions in
            an HR interview. Be honest while answering this question. Do not hesitate to mention your strengths but try
            to keep the count to 3-4 only by picking up the main strength that will help you in this job. While
            mentioning weaknesses, try to present it as a strength or get prepared for the answer to “How do you prepare
            to overcome this weakness?”.</li>
        <li><strong>Why should you be hired?</strong> The best way to answer this question is to present your skills to
            the interviewer and how are you planning to use it for the growth of the company.</li>
        <li><strong>How will you manage work pressure?</strong> Try to answer this question by giving examples of your
            previous experiences. Tell him/her about a situation in your life so far where you have been under pressure
            and still you managed to complete the task within deadline.</li>
        <li><strong>Why do you want to join us?</strong> This question will reflect the amount of research you have done
            about the company. You can mention the achievements of the company, work culture, behavior with employees,
            work-life balance and other positive things about the company.</li>
        <li><strong>What is your salary expectation?</strong> This can be a tricky question. If you are a fresher, never
            ever quote the exact amount that you want on your offer letter. You may ask him/her about the hike that the
            company generally offers to the employees but do not quote the amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Are you comfortable with rotational shifts?</strong> This is a most commonly asked question in the
            interviews of IT companies like TCS, CTS, Wipro, Infosys etc. Answering this question with a “Yes” will
            surely increase your chances of getting the job but it is recommended to say Yes only if you are actually
            comfortable with rotational shifts.</li>
        <li><strong>Why are you looking for a Job change?</strong> This is a common question if you are an experienced
            professional and looking for a change. The best way to answer this question is to say that, You are changing
            your current job for growth. Make sure that you not talk negatively about or criticize the company you are
            currently working in.</li>
    </ol>

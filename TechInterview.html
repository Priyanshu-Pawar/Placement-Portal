    <h2 class="prep">How to prep for a tech interview</h2>
    <p class="tech">To prepare for your next technical interview, make sure to:</p>
    <h3 class="head">1. Consider the tools and skills necessary for the role.</h3>
    <p class="info">Think about the basic requirements of the job. Reviewing the
        job description to determine what you need to study is fundamental. This may include things like working with
        data structures, coding in a specific language or using business intelligence tools.</p>
    <p class="info">A strong understanding of the basics will put you in a good
        position to answer any applicable interview questions. You can create an outline of what you need to study or
        refresh your knowledge by focusing on the basic principles required for the technical role.</p>
    <h3 class="head">2. Study helpful books and digital publications.</h3>
    <p class="info">With an understanding of what you need to work on, you can
        begin selecting materials to help you be more successful. This may come in the form of books, online coursework
        or digital publications:</p>
    <ul class="rich-text-component css-8gc1pn eu4oa1w0">
        <li class="rich-text-component css-1m2btmv eu4oa1w0">
            <p class="rich-text-component css-1rr6t3x e1wnkr790"><span class="css-je7s01 eu4oa1w0">Books.</span> Reading
                books on things like coding or management styles can help you increase your knowledge and provide
                confident, thorough answers in your interview.<br></p>
        </li>
        <li class="rich-text-component css-1m2btmv eu4oa1w0">
            <p class="rich-text-component css-1rr6t3x e1wnkr790"><span class="css-je7s01 eu4oa1w0">Online
                    coursework.</span> Reviewing online coursework can help with the practical application of technical
                skills.<br></p>
        </li>
        <li class="rich-text-component css-1m2btmv eu4oa1w0">
            <p class="rich-text-component css-1rr6t3x e1wnkr790"><span class="css-je7s01 eu4oa1w0">Digital
                    publications.</span> Online publications can help you expand your knowledge-base, but also keep you
                aware of trends in technology that may be relevant to your interview.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="head">3. Practice for the interview.</h3>
    <p class="info">Many technical jobs are based on mathematics. To prepare for
        the practical elements of a job interview, like take-home work or in-person problem-solving, you can practice
        logical equation strings that make sense for the position. Thinking out loud can help during this process. Not
        only is it a good way to stay engaged while solving complex problems, but it's also important for interviewers
        to know your thought process. That being said, try thinking out loud while you solve practice problems to better
        prepare for your technical interview.</p>
    <h3 class="head">4. Be a conversationalist and prepare to ask questions.</h3>
    <p class="info">To better prepare for the conversation, have a few questions
        you'd like to ask the interviewer ready. This will likely require additional research on your part. Take some
        time to review the company and job description before the interview, and jot down any questions that arise. It's
        also customary for candidates to hold their questions for the end of the interview, so consider that before
        jumping into your own pre-scripted questions.</p>
    <h3 class="head">5. Take the time you need.</h3>
    <p class="info">Whether answering take-home coding questions or using a
        whiteboard in real-time at your interview, take the time you need to solve the problem and check your work. If
        you slow down and make sure not to rush, you're likely to have fewer errors.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h2>Basic questions to ask in technical interviews</h2>
        <p>Core business activities determine an organisation’s talent requirements. A candidate’s technical ability and
            understanding of the business will determine their ability to perform the job. You can assess the
            candidate’s basic knowledge of the subject, problem solving skills,
            coding skills, and other requisites through an online test. The type of technical skills assessed during
            these tests may vary depending on the job role.</p>
